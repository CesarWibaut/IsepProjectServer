# IsepProjectServer
End scholarship project at ISEP (Porto, Portugal)


This is the project we're doing at ISEP (Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto)
It's a web server with a web application which allows you to list movies, rate them, and get movie recommandations from those ratings.

We're also working on a mobile application.
You can find it here : https://github.com/JeromeRohaert/Project_ISEP_Porto_Android_2018


The two projects are linked to the same databases.

We're using the movie database API to help us out
https://www.themoviedb.org

We're working on a maven project which is deployed on a Tomcat8 Server

Embedded database used : SQLite (jdbi connector)
